## Career Story

Hojun is a roboticist interested in technologies for robotic manipulation. He has majorly explored such interests through smart manufacturing which combines robotics, IoT, machine learning, and so on to make manufacturing systems more flexible to unforeseeable events.

In his latest work, Hojun has focused on computer vision task for visual servoing. In particular, He has combined deep learning with other classical data processing algorithms and deployed them on a mobile robot to achieve real-time multi-sensor aided pose estimation and grasping.
