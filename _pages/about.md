## Career Story

I am a roboticist specifically interested in manipulation. I have majorly explored such interests through smart manufacturing which combines robotics, IoT, and machine learning to make manufacturing systems more flexible to unforeseeable events. I am currently focusing on single/multi modal based servoing. In my latest work, I fused deep learning with other classical algorithms and deployed them on a mobile robot to achieve real-time multi-sensor aided object pose tracking and grasping.


## Personal Story

When I was fourteen, my dad and I went on a backpacking trip to Shiraz, a small city in south-central Iran. As we were both fanatics of history and ancient civilizations, Shiraz was the tenth destination on our excavatory journey around the world. On a hot sunny morning, we set out to visit the historical sites of the Mesopotamian civilization, located miles out from the city center. But absent the advent of Google Maps, we struggled to find our way. Holding scrappy paper maps in our hands and scrambling to get hold of locals who barely spoke English, we stood in the steaming Persian heat, stranded. Then, a taxi came by.

With ample enthusiasm and body language, our taxi driver drove us around the city and introduced the history behind the monuments in Persepolis. Our taxi tour of the city was a panoramic dive into the history of Iran, as we cross-checked in our heads what we had learned from ancient historical documents. Our driver then invited us for dinner with his family. Munching on Koobideh Kabab, we learned about the Iranian family structure, educational system, and home-cooking, all of which gave us an intimate peek into everyday Iranian life. 

Growing up as an avid traveler, I cultivated a joy for exploring new and foreign terrains with curiosity and an appreciation for the unanticipated discoveries along the way. I also learned that such discoveries often came from encounters with other minds. Over time, my knack for exploration encouraged me to venture abroad from South Korea and move to the United States for college to become a robotics researcher.
